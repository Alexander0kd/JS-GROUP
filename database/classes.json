        "description": "Death Knights engage their foes up-close, supplementing swings of their weapons with dark magic that renders enemies vulnerable or damages them with unholy power. They drag foes into one-on-one conflicts, compelling them to focus their attacks away from weaker companions. To prevent their enemies from fleeing their grasp, death knights must remain mindful of the power they call forth from runes, and pace their attacks appropriately. Death Knights can tank in the Blood specialization, or DPS as Frost and Unholy.",

                "title": "Blood Death Knight",
                "description": "As one of the six tank specializations in the game, our design as Blood Death Knights involves a reactive, optimization-driven playstyle: generating as much Runic Power as possible through spells and abilities, prioritizing the right one at the right time, and healing the damage you take back up with  Death Strike. Our toolkit breadth holds a variety of answers for many situations, ranging from self-sustain cooldowns such as  Vampiric Blood and  Dancing Rune Weapon, immunities to specific mechanics, a combat resurrection for allies, and even a pet ghoul acting as a source of DPS thanks to  Raise Dead!\n\nBlood Death Knights are designed to excel in fights where damage is very high but not lethal; a large portion of our kit scales off damage taken, allowing us to heal for more and more as the damage taken gets higher. Obviously, this has a limit (when you die), but in the hands of a skilled player, this specialization is a force to be reckoned with.\n\nOverall, we are the jack-of-all-trades tank. We have answers to everything, although they may not be the most powerful answers individually. We bring a temporary immunity to magic debuffs and curses, a combat ress, and hands-down the best slow in the game ( Grip of the Dead).\n\nAs the original hero class, Death Knights start at level 8 rather than level 1. All races from both the Horde and the Alliance can be Death Knights. If you like deep, engaging gameplay as a tank, and a rotation that truly rewards clever planning, we strongly encourage you to give Blood a try!",
                "strengths": "Excellent self-sustain when played optimally\nUnique group utility:  Anti-Magic Zone,  Death Grip,  Gorefiend's Grasp\nTemporary immunity to Charm, Fear and Sleep effects ( Lichborne), Stuns ( Icebound Fortitude)\nKnockback immunity ( Death's Advance\nAbility to immune most magic debuffs and curses with  Anti-Magic Shell\nTwo separate taunts:  Dark Command,  Death Grip\nAn AoE disorient on a very short cooldown ( Blinding Sleet)\nUndead-only crowd control:  Control Undead\nAccess to an uncapped cheat death:  Purgatory",
                "weaknesses": "Lower damage than most tanks\nA significant portion of our damage is tied to us getting meleed by enemies\nLimited mobility:  Death's Advance baseline, with two potential talents to augment this:\n Death's Echo to gain a second charge of  Death's Advance\n Wraith Walk\nWe are tuned around taking higher amounts of damage upfront and healing it back. This leaves us open to being bursted down without being able to, well, heal it up. You can't heal when you're dead.\nIn Dragonflight, the design of the spec severely punishes mistakes, but the punishment has no immediate feedback."

Bear Form increasing Armor and Stamina by huge amounts and Barkskin giving a 20% damage reduction on top of it. The downside to this is the significant loss in damage, but the huge amounts of survivability make up for it.\nControl and Utility - Druid, as a class, has a large amount of utility and control in the form of  Innervate,  Entangling Roots, and  Typhoon and the talent row consisting of  Mass Entanglement, and  Mighty Bash.",
                "weaknesses": "Long Multi-Target Ramp Up Time - The long multi-target ramp up time stems from the fact that it takes a significant amount of time to be able to  Moonfire all the mobs. This creates for significantly lower multi-target burst than many other classes. As for single target, building your initial Astral Power pool itself takes 10 - 15 seconds making you really slow off the start.\nLack of talent strength - Currently the base kit for Moonkin is pretty strong, while the talents themselves don't have much impact on damage. You’re forced into a couple of specific potential builds for fights with only ever a few flex points. This gives the Balance Druid player very little agency when deciding what to pick for the encounter, and can create issues especially when other classes are not balanced this way."

Beast Mastery is the only ranged DPS specialization in the game that can do 100% of its damage while moving, with no restrictions whatsoever (except for  Wailing Arrow). This provides a huge benefit in any sort of PvE content, as you can always do mechanics or deal with whatever is going on without wasting any damage, something no other ranged DPS can do. By combining this mobility with a powerful immunity in  Aspect of the Turtle, which can frequently be used to cheese mechanics, Beast Mastery Hunters are perfect for doing odd-jobs and any sort of mechanical challenges that raids and dungeons might present.\n\nDespite being ranged, most of your damage as a Beast Mastery Hunter come from your pets which have to be in melee range of the target. A large portion of this pet damage is controlled directly or indirectly by you as the Hunter rather than happening automatically. Pets also help Beast Mastery Hunters become great for solo content, by acting as tanks.",

Fire Mage has always been known for its offensive focus, high damage, and cleave in the form of  Mastery: Ignite. If you are looking for a specialization that lets you turn your enemies into bonfires with legs, spreading their flame to other nearby enemies, then look no further.\n\nFire Mage is a cloth wearing caster damage dealer and one of a handful of ranged caster specializations in World of Warcraft that focuses on cleave rather than spread damage over time. It is a very high burst playstyle, as most of your damage comes during your  Combustion.

A master of arms who can also rely on a concealed pistol to support them in combat and surprise the enemy? In that case, you may want to give Outlaw a try!\n\nLike any Rogue spec, Outlaw uses Energy to attack targets. These attacks can usually be classified as either a Builder, that generates Combo Points, or a Finisher, that consumes these Combo Points for a powerful strike.\n\nOutlaw is a very fast-paced spec where you can hit a lot of buttons for direct damage. It has the iconic  Blade Flurry mechanic, allowing you to do AoE damage by continuing with your standard rotation, instead of relying on AoE-specific abilities and rotations.\n\nOften seen as a somewhat deterring aspect of the spec,  Roll the Bones is not very transparent to newcomers, but adds some variance to how it performs. You should not let that interfere with your enjoyment of this specialization.",
