        "description": "With trolls becoming once again relevant during Pandaria Remix, Warrior players have noticed some accidental, if hilarious, utility!\n\nThe Arms Warrior Legion Artifact, Strom'kar, the Warbreaker Strom'kar, the Warbreaker, has a secondary hidden effect -  Surrounded by Trolls! generates an aura of fear on trolls, forcing them to run away in fear from you. This effect applies even if you're just transmogging a Strom'kar appearance but not actually wearing the weapon.\n\nThis weapon can be transmogged by both Arms and Fury Warriors (Fury Warriors will need to look for Strom'kar under the 2H Sword appearance section).\n\nDuring Remix: Mists of Pandaria, this effect sees renewed utility, as Throne of Thunder is one of the areas in which this effect is activated! It goes as far as working on raid bosses themselves - Below, we have a few seconds of the Council of Elders fight in Throne of Thunder."

        "description": "Blizzard has responded to feedback regarding the Priest Hero Talent Tree, Voidweaver! Blizzard:\nThe Voidweaver changes in today’s Alpha build are experimental and were aimed at trying to resolve an issue where Void Torrent was required to make the hero talent tree work.\nWe hear you that the gameplay isn’t as smooth with spawning an Entropic Rift from Shadow Crash, and we will likely move it back to spawning from Void Torrent.\nOn Shadow Crash firing at your target instead of using a reticle: this was also an experimental change, and if we do end up moving forward with this change in place, we will provide an option to players to use a reticle through a choice node."

Now, he teaches the other Void Elves in Telogrus Rift, and players can listen in on one of his lessons!\nLocus-Walker\nPlayers who approach Locus-Walker during Alleria Windrunner's Hunt for the Harbinger questline can ask him about his decision to teach the ren-dorei about the Void, and even hang around to overhear a lesson about maintaining sanity even in the face of the Void's whispers.\nDo you wish to learn more of the Void? It has many lessons to teach us amongst its maddening whispers.\nOne must simply learn to properly listen.\n Why have you chosen to teach the ren'dorei about the Void?\nYour question is not without merit. Long ago, I chose to teach Alleria about the ways of the Void. But she had proven herself worthy of such lessons with my rescue from the Legion.\nPerhaps I merely wish to sate my own curiosity. And Telogrus Rift and the ren'dorei are both quite the curiosities, aren't they?\n"

Before she departs, she visits her lost home of Silvermoon on a mission of peace and connection. Much remains unsaid between Alleria and her son, Arator—hindered by fear and misunderstanding—but Alleria would have her son know his mother and her intentions before a new evil threatens Azeroth again.\nThe afternoon sun filtered through the crimson leaves overhead as Alleria Windrunner walked the path toward Silvermoon City. In times past, happier times, she might have flown or used a portal to appear inside the city walls, but as it was, she approached warily, as if nearing a sleeping beast that did not wake gently. Once, she had defended these walls, these people. But now?\nNow, to many, she was the source of danger.\nRead and download this short story by Delilah S. Dawson."
